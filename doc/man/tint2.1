.B tint

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B tint
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBtint\fP is a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but 
should also work with other window managers. It's based on ttm code. The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with code lightweight and 
compliance with freedesktop specifications.
.PP
On the first startup tint creates a config file in $HOME/.config/tint/tintrc.
See the /usr/share/tint2/doc directory for more information.
